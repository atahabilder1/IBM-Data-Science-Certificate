# IBM Data Science Capstone Project

## Project Overview
I enrolled in the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program** on Coursera, and this repository represents the **final Capstone Project**, which is a formal requirement for completing the program.  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end application of data science skills that I have acquired throughout the program. This includes data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, SQL-based analysis, interactive dashboards, and predictive modeling.  

This repository, along with the submitted presentation, fulfills the requirements of the Capstone Project and demonstrates my ability to apply data science methods to solve a real-world style problem.

## Data Sources
- Datasets created or converted specifically for this project.  
- Additional wrangling and transformations were performed within the Jupyter notebooks.  

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Executive Summary & Introduction** – Project goals and overview  
2. **Data Collection & Wrangling** – Cleaning and preparing datasets  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Insights with visualizations and SQL queries  
4. **Interactive Visualizations** – Folium maps & Plotly Dash dashboards  
5. **Predictive Modeling** – Classification analysis and results  
6. **Conclusion** – Key findings, insights, and recommendations

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Folium, Plotly Dash, SQL (SQLite/IBM Db2)  
- **Platforms:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub  

---

## Important Note on Environment
Some of the project notebooks were executed in the **Coursera virtual lab environment**, while others were executed **locally in Jupyter Notebook**.  

- The Coursera environment was used for initial development and validation.  
- Local execution was necessary for certain visualizations (e.g., **Folium maps**), which required trust permissions that could not be enabled in the online lab.  
- This demonstrates flexibility and ensures that the analysis and results remain reproducible and consistent with course requirements.

## Deliverables
- All project Jupyter notebooks  
- Final presentation in PDF format  
- This GitHub repository (official course requirement)
