# IBM Data Science Capstone Project

## Project Overview
I enrolled in the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program** on Coursera, and this repository represents the **final Capstone Project**, which is a formal requirement for completing the program.  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end application of data science skills that I have acquired throughout the program. This includes data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, SQL-based analysis, interactive dashboards, and predictive modeling.  

This repository, along with the submitted presentation, fulfills the requirements of the Capstone Project and demonstrates my ability to apply data science methods to solve a real-world style problem.
